# dvqcc: Dynamical VAR-model based control charts for batch processes

## Package may be downloaded on CRAN

  This package contains a set of control charts  for online and offline monitoring data from batch processes based on the VAR (vector Autoregressive) model. These data can be read from external databases or simulated through the dvqcc package itself



## The package contains functions for Dynamic VAR-model based Control Charts (Marcondes Filho, D., & Valk, M., 2020):

* Function to simulate datasets based on the VAR(1) model (without intercept). The dataset include in control batches and new batches for offline and online monitoring
* Offline and Online T2.var and W.var control charts for monitoring batch processes based on VAR model
